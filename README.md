## Project
I started this project years ago.  

The original purpose was to build a tile-based 3d game engine for making small games.  

Early on I decided to never complete it, and use it as a base for teaching myself OpenGL and exploring concepts.  With no expectations to release the project I could pick it up and put it down when I wanted to and work on any piece of it I felt like at the time.
